The World Happiness Report is a valuable resource that provides insights into the well-being and happiness of people in various countries, but the data can be overwhelming and challenging to interpret. We aim to simplify this process by building an intuitive and user-friendly app that offers a dynamic visual representation of the data. Our motivation for this project is to bridge the gap between valuable but complex data and the end-users who seek to understand it. We believe that by creating an interactive Shiny app for the World Happiness Report, we can empower individuals, researchers, and policymakers to explore and gain insights into global happiness, contributing to a better understanding of well-being and, potentially, to informed decisions that can improve the quality of life for people around the world.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\"Are you happy?\" Despite being a straightforward question, philosophers, artists, and scientists have been captivated by it for millennia. We take a wonderful tour through the World Happiness Report dataset in our quest to discover what makes people truly happy around the world. This proposal describes how we want to investigate and examine this interesting dataset, which runs from 2015 to 2023. This project attempts to solve the puzzles of happiness in a playful and interesting way. Happiness is a universal quest.\n\n## Dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_2015 <- read.csv(\"data/2015.csv\")\ndf_2016 <- read.csv(\"data/2016.csv\")\ndf_2017 <- read.csv(\"data/2017.csv\")\ndf_2018 <- read.csv(\"data/2018.csv\")\ndf_2019 <- read.csv(\"data/2019.csv\")\ndf_2020 <- read.csv(\"data/2020.csv\")\ndf_2021 <- read.csv(\"data/2021.csv\")\ndf_2022 <- read.csv(\"data/2022.csv\")\ndf_2023 <- read.csv(\"data/2023.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nWe are excited to embark on a journey to explore the [World Happiness Report dataset](https://worldhappiness.report/data/), encompassing the years 2015 to 2023.

How do various factors contribute to the overall happiness score across different countries over the years?\n2.  Can we identify patterns of change in happiness scores related to global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n### Approach for Question 1\n\nThe different factors involved are as follows : economy (\"GDP per capita\"), family (\"social support\"), health(\"healthy life expectancy at birth\"), freedom (\"freedom to make life choices\"), trust(\"perceptions of corruption\") and genorosity (\"genorosity\").\n\n-   **Objective:** Enable users to interactively explore the impact of different variables on happiness scores using a customized interface. The app will feature three dropdown menus: one for selecting countries, one for the x-axis variable, and another for the y-axis variable.\n\n-   **Visualization:** The app will present a customizable scatter plot. Users can select specific years using buttons to display a single point on the graph. Hovering over each point will reveal detailed information about the chosen variables for that point.\n\n-   **Insights and Exploration:** The goal is to identify consistent factors impacting happiness scores across countries and years by allowing users to dynamically visualize and explore data points.\n\n### Approach for Question 2\n\n-   **Variables Involved:**\n\n    Year (Data Type: Integer): To identify the annual data points and capture trends over time.\n\n    Country (Data Type: Character): For geographical mapping and comparison between nations.\n\n    Happiness Score and related factors (Data Type: Double): To analyze changes and correlations.\n\n-   **Variables to be Created:**\n\n    Pandemic Period (Data Type: Character): A derived variable indicating pre-pandemic, during-pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.\n\n    Change in Happiness Score (Data Type: Double): The difference in happiness scores from one year to the next.\n\n    Average Change per Period (Data Type: Double): The average change in happiness scores for each period (pre, during, post-pandemic).\n\n-   **Analysis and Visualization:**\n\n    Trend Analysis: Create line graphs to visualize happiness scores over the years, with a clear demarcation of the pandemic period.\n\n    Pandemic Impact: Zoom in on the period of the pandemic to analyze specific shifts or anomalies in happiness trends.\n\n    Correlation and Comparison: Utilize heatmaps to provide a visual correlation matrix between happiness scores and other variables. Conduct statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) to contrast the differences in happiness levels across different periods.\n\n    Causality and Control: Implement a causal analysis, such as difference-in-differences, to evaluate the pandemic's impact on happiness while controlling for other variables like GDP per capita.\n\n    Visualizations: Develop visualizations that highlight the onset of the pandemic, using markers or shaded areas on the line graphs. Create scatter plots and box plots to compare happiness against other variables across different timeframes.\n\n    Shiny App Features: Intuitive UI guiding through data and findings. Reactive visuals that update with user input. Interactive elements like sliders and drop downs for custom analyses.\n\n    Analysis and Reporting: Note regional happiness shifts and anomalies. Combine statistical results and visual insights. Conclude on the link between pandemic and happiness scores, considering data limits.\n\n    #### Note:\n\n    In the event of encountering global occurrences beyond COVID-19 that have a sustained impact on the world, we will incorporate them into our future considerations.\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n### Week 1: (Oct 16 - Oct 22) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Data Selection and Initial Planning*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Identify and download the World Happiness Report dataset.\n    -   Clean and preprocess the data, removing any inconsistencies or missing values.\n    -   Familiarizing with the dataset's structure and variables.\n    -   Analysing more on the specific questions we want to address and the visualizations.\n    -   Begin designing a rough sketch of the shiny app's layout.\n\n### Week 2: (Oct 23 - Oct 29)\\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Proposal Writing*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Write a project proposal that includes the project's goals, objectives, and scope.\n    -   Define the questions you aim to answer with the shiny application.\n    -   Outline the design and interactivity features we plan to include.\n    -   Create a project timeline with specific milestones.\n\n### Week 3: (Oct 30 - Nov 5) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Data Exploration and Visualization Planning*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.\n    -   Identify interesting patterns, correlations, or outliers in the data.\n    -   Sketch initial ideas for the app's layout and visualizations.\n\n### Week 4: (Nov 6 - Nov 12) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Shiny Application Layout Designing*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Select the tools and libraries to be used for creating the app.\n    -   Plan the layout, including the placement of plots, widgets, and navigation.\n    -   Create a wireframe for user interface.\n\n### Week 5: (Nov 13 - Nov 19) \\[TBD\\]\n\n#### *Plot Creation*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Develop the plots and interactive components.\n    -   Ensure that the plots represent the data accurately and are visually appealing.\n    -   Initial integration of interactive elements into the shiny app.\n\n### Week 6: (Nov 20 - Nov 26) \\[TBD\\]\n\n#### *Shiny App Development and Refinement*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Code the functionality of the app using Shiny's reactive elements.\n    -   Implement interactivity features like dropdowns and filters.\n    -   Test the app's performance and user experience.\n\n### Week 7: (Nov 27 - Dec 3) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Testing and Modifications*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Conduct testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.\n    -   Gather feedback.\n    -   Make improvements based on the feedback received.\n\n### Week 8: (Dec 4 - Dec11) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Finalization and Presentation*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Make any final refinements to the application.\n    -   Complete the write-up or documentation.\n    -   Prepare a presentation for the project.\n\n## Repo Organisation\n\n1.
