How do various factors contribute to the overall happiness score across different countries over the years?\n2.  Can we identify patterns of change in happiness scores related to global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   **Approach for Question 1**\n\n    The different factors involved are as follows : economy (\"GDP per capita\"), family (\"social support\"), health(\"healthy life expectancy at birth\"), freedom (\"freedom to make life choices\"), trust(\"perceptions of corruption\") and genorosity (\"genorosity\").\n\n    To explore how various factors contribute to the overall happiness score across different countries over the years, we have designed an interactive analysis where users can select a specific year and country from drop-down menus, allowing for a dynamic and personalized exploration of the data. We are planning to create a bar chart where the x-axis represents the factors (independent variables), and the y-axis represents their contribution to the overall happiness score. For better visulaization we are planning to choose a Grouped Bar chart, where separate bars represents each factor, and their heights represent their contributions to the overall happiness score. This chart provides a side-by-side comparison of each factor's contribution. We are planning to expand the analysis by incorporating a stacked bar plot to gain more comprehensive visualization.\n\n-   **Approach for Question 2**\n\n    **Variables Involved:**\n\n    Year (Data Type: Integer): To identify the annual data points and capture trends over time.\n\n    Country (Data Type: Character): For geographical mapping and comparison between nations.\n\n    Happiness Score and related factors (Data Type: Double): To analyze changes and correlations.\n\n    **Variables to be Created:**\n\n    Pandemic Period (Data Type: Character): A derived variable indicating pre-pandemic, during-pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.\n\n    Change in Happiness Score (Data Type: Double): The difference in happiness scores from one year to the next.\n\n    Average Change per Period (Data Type: Double): The average change in happiness scores for each period (pre, during, post-pandemic).\n\n    **Analysis and Visualization:**\n\n    Trend Analysis: Create line graphs to visualize happiness scores over the years, with a clear demarcation of the pandemic period.\n\n    Pandemic Impact: Zoom in on the period of the pandemic to analyze specific shifts or anomalies in happiness trends.\n\n    Correlation and Comparison: Utilize heatmaps to provide a visual correlation matrix between happiness scores and other variables. Conduct statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) to contrast the differences in happiness levels across different periods.\n\n    Causality and Control: Implement a causal analysis, such as difference-in-differences, to evaluate the pandemic's impact on happiness while controlling for other variables like GDP per capita.\n\n    Visualizations: Develop visualizations that highlight the onset of the pandemic, using markers or shaded areas on the line graphs. Create scatter plots and box plots to compare happiness against other variables across different timeframes.\n\n    Shiny App Features: Intuitive UI guiding through data and findings. Reactive visuals that update with user input. Interactive elements like sliders and drop downs for custom analyses.\n\n    Analysis and Reporting: Note regional happiness shifts and anomalies. Combine statistical results and visual insights. Conclude on the link between pandemic and happiness scores, considering data limits.\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n#### Week 1: (Oct 16 - Oct 22) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Data Selection and Initial Planning*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Identify and download the World Happiness Report dataset.\n    -   Clean and preprocess the data, removing any inconsistencies or missing values.\n    -   Familiarizing with the dataset's structure and variables.\n    -   Analysing more on the specific questions we want to address and the visualizations.\n    -   Begin designing a rough sketch of the shiny app's layout.\n\n#### Week 2: (Oct 23 - Oct 29)\\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Proposal Writing*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Write a project proposal that includes the project's goals, objectives, and scope.\n    -   Define the questions you aim to answer with the shiny application.\n    -   Outline the design and interactivity features we plan to include.\n    -   Create a project timeline with specific milestones.\n\n#### Week 3: (Oct 30 - Nov 5) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Data Exploration and Visualization Planning*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.\n    -   Identify interesting patterns, correlations, or outliers in the data.\n    -   Sketch initial ideas for the app's layout and visualizations.\n\n#### Week 4: (Nov 6 - Nov 12) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Shiny Application Layout Designing*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Select the tools and libraries to be used for creating the app.\n    -   Plan the layout, including the placement of plots, widgets, and navigation.\n    -   Create a wireframe for user interface.\n\n#### Week 5: (Nov 13 - Nov 19) \\[TBD\\]\n\n#### *Plot Creation*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Develop the plots and interactive components.\n    -   Ensure that the plots represent the data accurately and are visually appealing.\n    -   Initial integration of interactive elements into the shiny app.\n\n#### Week 6: (Nov 20 - Nov 26) \\[TBD\\]\n\n#### *Shiny App Development and Refinement*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Code the functionality of the app using Shiny's reactive elements.\n    -   Implement interactivity features like dropdowns and filters.\n    -   Test the app's performance and user experience.\n\n#### Week 7: (Nov 27 - Dec 3) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Testing and Modifications*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Conduct testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.\n    -   Gather feedback.\n    -   Make improvements based on the feedback received.\n\n#### Week 8: (Dec 4 - Dec11) \\[Everyone\\]\n\n#### *Finalization and Presentation*\n\n-   *Tasks:*\n    -   Make any final refinements to the application.\n    -   Complete the write-up or documentation.\n    -   Prepare a presentation for the project.\n\n## Repo Organisation\n\n1.
