    "text": "Goal and Motivation\nOur primary goal with this project is to develop an interactive shiny application that makes the complex data from the World Happiness Report accessible and engaging for a wide audience. The World Happiness Report is a valuable resource that provides insights into the well-being and happiness of people in various countries, but the data can be overwhelming and challenging to interpret. We aim to simplify this process by building an intuitive and user-friendly app that offers a dynamic visual representation of the data. Our motivation for this project is to bridge the gap between valuable but complex data and the end-users who seek to understand it. We believe that by creating an interactive Shiny app for the World Happiness Report, we can empower individuals, researchers, and policymakers to explore and gain insights into global happiness, contributing to a better understanding of well-being and, potentially, to informed decisions that can improve the quality of life for people around the world."

    "text": "Introduction\n“Are you happy?” Despite being a straightforward question, philosophers, artists, and scientists have been captivated by it for millennia. We take a wonderful tour through the World Happiness Report dataset in our quest to discover what makes people truly happy around the world. This proposal describes how we want to investigate and examine this interesting dataset, which runs from 2015 to 2023. This project attempts to solve the puzzles of happiness in a playful and interesting way. Happiness is a universal quest."

    "text": "Dataset\n\nDataset Description\nWe are excited to embark on a journey to explore the World Happiness Report dataset, encompassing the years 2015 to 2023. This engaging and illuminating dataset offers a unique glimpse into the factors influencing global happiness and well-being. Let’s dive into the details of our chosen dataset:\nThe World Happiness Report dataset is sourced directly from the official World Happiness Report website. This esteemed report is published annually by the United Nations, offering insights into the state of happiness and well-being across countries. The dataset is meticulously compiled, verified, and updated each year, making it a reliable source for our analysis.\n\n\nDimensions\nMultiple annual observations, varying from 149 to 158 countries per year.\nCommon variables across dataset:\nCountry:\nData Type: Character (chr)\nDescription: The name of the country for which the happiness metrics are recorded.\nHappiness Rank:\nData Type: Integer (int)\nDescription: The rank of the country is based on its happiness score.\nHappiness Score:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The score that quantifies the happiness level, is based on various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.\nGDP per Capita:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: A measure of the country’s economic output that accounts for its population.\nFamily:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The degree to which social support is provided in the country, reflecting family ties or community support.\nHealth (Life Expectancy):\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: Average life expectancy in the country, indicating the overall health of the population.\nFreedom:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The level of freedom citizens have to make life choices in the country.\nTrust (Government Corruption):\nData Type: Double (dbl) \nDescription: The level of trust in the country’s government and the perceived amount of corruption.\nGenerosity:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The average level of generosity of the country’s citizens.\nDystopia Residual:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: A hypothetical measure that accounts for the unexplained components of happiness from the six factors evaluated.\n\n\nReason for Choosing this Dataset\nThe World Happiness Report dataset offers a perfect blend of intriguing questions and meaningful insights. By exploring this dataset, we aim to understand the factors that contribute to happiness and well-being across diverse societies. Furthermore, we chose this dataset for the following reasons:\n1. Global Relevance: Happiness is a fundamental aspect of human well-being, and this dataset provides a unique perspective on happiness trends worldwide. Our analysis can offer insights into what makes societies and individuals happy, transcending borders and cultures.\n2. Temporal Insights: The dataset covers a wide range of years, enabling us to track happiness trends and identify potential causative factors over time. This temporal dimension adds depth to our analysis.\n\n\nCleaned Dataset for all Years(2015-2023)\n\n\nRows: 1,368\nColumns: 11\n$ Country                         &lt;chr&gt; \"Switzerland\", \"Iceland\", \"Denmark\", \"…\n$ `Happiness Rank`                &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,…\n$ `Happiness Score`               &lt;dbl&gt; 7.587, 7.561, 7.527, 7.522, 7.427, 7.4…\n$ `GDP per Capita`                &lt;dbl&gt; 1.39651, 1.30232, 1.32548, 1.45900, 1.…\n$ Family                          &lt;dbl&gt; 1.34951, 1.40223, 1.36058, 1.33095, 1.…\n$ `Health (Life Expectancy)`      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.94143, 0.94784, 0.87464, 0.88521, 0.…\n$ Freedom                         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.66557, 0.62877, 0.64938, 0.66973, 0.…\n$ `Trust (Government Corruption)` &lt;dbl&gt; 0.41978, 0.14145, 0.48357, 0.36503, 0.…\n$ Generosity                      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.29678, 0.43630, 0.34139, 0.34699, 0.…\n$ `Dystopia Residual`             &lt;dbl&gt; 2.51738, 2.70201, 2.49204, 2.46531, 2.…\n$ Year                            &lt;dbl&gt; 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 20…"

This allows users to customize their data exploration.\nVisualization: Chart Selection - Planning to create a Grouped Bar chart for visualizing the contributions of different factors to the overall happiness score. In this chart, each factor is represented by a separate bar, and the height of each bar corresponds to its contribution to the overall happiness score. Also panning to expand the analysis by introducing a stacked bar plot. This plot adds a layer of depth to the analysis by visually representing how multiple factors contribute to the overall happiness score within the same bar, allowing users to see the combined effect of these factors.\n\nInsights and Exploration: Observing and Highlighting factors that consistently impact happiness scores across different countries and years.\n\n\nApproach for Question 2\n\nVariables Involved:\nYear (Data Type: Integer): To identify the annual data points and capture trends over time.\nCountry (Data Type: Character): For geographical mapping and comparison between nations.\nHappiness Score and related factors (Data Type: Double): To analyze changes and correlations.\nVariables to be Created:\nPandemic Period (Data Type: Character): A derived variable indicating pre-pandemic, during-pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.\nChange in Happiness Score (Data Type: Double): The difference in happiness scores from one year to the next.\nAverage Change per Period (Data Type: Double): The average change in happiness scores for each period (pre, during, post-pandemic).\nAnalysis and Visualization:\nTrend Analysis: Create line graphs to visualize happiness scores over the years, with a clear demarcation of the pandemic period.\nPandemic Impact: Zoom in on the period of the pandemic to analyze specific shifts or anomalies in happiness trends.\nCorrelation and Comparison: Utilize heatmaps to provide a visual correlation matrix between happiness scores and other variables. Conduct statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) to contrast the differences in happiness levels across different periods.\nCausality and Control: Implement a causal analysis, such as difference-in-differences, to evaluate the pandemic’s impact on happiness while controlling for other variables like GDP per capita.\nVisualizations: Develop visualizations that highlight the onset of the pandemic, using markers or shaded areas on the line graphs. Create scatter plots and box plots to compare happiness against other variables across different timeframes.\nShiny App Features: Intuitive UI guiding through data and findings. Reactive visuals that update with user input. Interactive elements like sliders and drop downs for custom analyses.\nAnalysis and Reporting: Note regional happiness shifts and anomalies. Combine statistical results and visual insights. Conclude on the link between pandemic and happiness scores, considering data limits."
