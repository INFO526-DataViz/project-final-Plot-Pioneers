    "text": "Discussion\nAcross the temporal spectrum from 2015 to 2023, our observation between Family (social support) and Happiness Score revealed intriguing insights. Initially, higher degrees of family support aligned with notably higher happiness scores. Subsequently, while the scores remained elevated, both the number of instances and the degree of family support slightly decreased. However, a resurgence followed, mirroring the initial phase’s trend before experiencing a slight decline towards the end. Overall, this analysis underscores a proportional relationship, emphasizing that increased family support correlates positively with higher happiness scores—a compelling testament to its pivotal role as a contributing factor in fostering well-being.\nThe correlation between health and happiness scores appears relatively consistent from 2015 to 2023, showing limited variations. Western European countries consistently maintain top positions, while Sub-Saharan African nations consistently rank at the bottom in this regard. Over the years, a clear pattern emerged: as the economy (GDP per capita) grew, so did happiness scores. Though the intensity varied, the trend remained consistent. In 2022, this link intensified, indicating a proportional relationship between a thriving economy and higher happiness.\nWhen comparing Trust (government corruption) and Happiness Score across countries, intriguing trends emerged. Western European nations like Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, and Sweden showed higher corruption levels but sustained higher happiness. Conversely, countries like New Zealand, Singapore, and Qatar followed a similar pattern. Rwanda depicted the highest corruption and lowest happiness, while Sub-Saharan and some Eastern European nations showcased lower corruption but also lower happiness levels overall.\nUpon analyzing the relationship between happiness scores and freedom, it’s evident that since 2019, Afghanistan consistently exhibits the lowest happiness score. Meanwhile, the Western European region consistently maintains a top-ranking position in happiness scores from 2015 to 2023. When examining the correlation between happiness scores and generosity, it becomes evident that Finland consistently secures the top position throughout the years 2015 to 2023 in terms of happiness scores."
