The app will feature three drop-down menus: one for selecting countries, one for the x-axis variable, and another for the y-axis variable.\nVisualization: The app will present a customizable scatter plot. Users can select specific years using buttons to display a single point on the graph. Hovering over each point will reveal detailed information about the chosen variables for that point.\nInsights and Exploration: The goal is to identify consistent factors impacting happiness scores across countries and years by allowing users to dynamically visualize and explore data points.\n\n\n\nApproach for Question 2\n\nVariables Involved:\nYear (Data Type: Integer): To identify the annual data points and capture trends over time.\nCountry (Data Type: Character): For geographical mapping and comparison between nations.\nHappiness Score and related factors (Data Type: Double): To analyze changes and correlations.\nVariables to be Created:\nPandemic Period (Data Type: Character): A derived variable indicating pre-pandemic, during-pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.\nChange in Happiness Score (Data Type: Double): The difference in happiness scores from one year to the next.\nAverage Change per Period (Data Type: Double): The average change in happiness scores for each period (pre, during, post-pandemic).\nAnalysis and Visualization:\nTrend Analysis: Create line graphs to visualize happiness scores over the years, with a clear demarcation of the pandemic period.\nPandemic Impact: Zoom in on the period of the pandemic to analyze specific shifts or anomalies in happiness trends.\nCorrelation and Comparison: Utilize heatmaps to provide a visual correlation matrix between happiness scores and other variables. Conduct statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) to contrast the differences in happiness levels across different periods.\nCausality and Control: Implement a causal analysis, such as difference-in-differences, to evaluate the pandemic’s impact on happiness while controlling for other variables like GDP per capita.\nVisualizations: Develop visualizations that highlight the onset of the pandemic, using markers or shaded areas on the line graphs. Create scatter plots and box plots to compare happiness against other variables across different timeframes.\nShiny App Features: Intuitive UI guiding through data and findings. Reactive visuals that update with user input. Interactive elements like sliders and drop downs for custom analyses.\nAnalysis and Reporting: Note regional happiness shifts and anomalies. Combine statistical results and visual insights. Conclude on the link between pandemic and happiness scores, considering data limits.\nNote:\nIn the event of encountering global occurrences beyond COVID-19 that have a sustained impact on the world, we will incorporate them into our future considerations."

    "text": "Discussion\nAcross the temporal spectrum from 2015 to 2023, our observation between Family (social support) and Happiness Score revealed intriguing insights. Initially, higher degrees of family support aligned with notably higher happiness scores. Subsequently, while the scores remained elevated, both the number of instances and the degree of family support slightly decreased. However, a resurgence followed, mirroring the initial phase’s trend before experiencing a slight decline towards the end. Overall, this analysis underscores a proportional relationship, emphasizing that increased family support correlates positively with higher happiness scores—a compelling testament to its pivotal role as a contributing factor in fostering well-being.\nThe correlation between health and happiness scores appears relatively consistent from 2015 to 2023, showing limited variations. Western European countries consistently maintain top positions, while Sub-Saharan African nations consistently rank at the bottom in this regard. Over the years, a clear pattern emerged: as the economy (GDP per capita) grew, so did happiness scores. Though the intensity varied, the trend remained consistent. In 2022, this link intensified, indicating a proportional relationship between a thriving economy and higher happiness.\nWhen comparing Trust (government corruption) and Happiness Score across countries, intriguing trends emerged. Western European nations like Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, and Sweden showed higher corruption levels but sustained higher happiness. Conversely, countries like New Zealand, Singapore, and Qatar followed a similar pattern. Rwanda depicted the highest corruption and lowest happiness, while Sub-Saharan and some Eastern European nations showcased lower corruption but also lower happiness levels overall.\nUpon analyzing the relationship between happiness scores and freedom, it’s evident that since 2019, Afghanistan consistently exhibits the lowest happiness score. Meanwhile, the Western European region consistently maintains a top-ranking position in happiness scores from 2015 to 2023. When examining the correlation between happiness scores and generosity, it becomes evident that Finland consistently secures the top position throughout the years 2015 to 2023 in terms of happiness scores."
