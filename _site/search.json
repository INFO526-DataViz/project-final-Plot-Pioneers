    "text": "Dataset\n\nDataset Description\nWe are excited to embark on a journey to explore the World Happiness Report dataset, encompassing the years 2015 to 2023. This engaging and illuminating dataset offers a unique glimpse into the factors influencing global happiness and well-being. Let’s dive into the details of our chosen dataset:\nThe World Happiness Report dataset is sourced directly from the official World Happiness Report website. This esteemed report is published annually by the United Nations, offering insights into the state of happiness and well-being across countries. The dataset is meticulously compiled, verified, and updated each year, making it a reliable source for our analysis.\n\n\nDimensions\nMultiple annual observations, varying from 149 to 158 countries per year.\nCommon variables across dataset:\nCountry:\nData Type: Character (chr)\nDescription: The name of the country for which the happiness metrics are recorded.\nHappiness Rank:\nData Type: Integer (int)\nDescription: The rank of the country is based on its happiness score.\nHappiness Score:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The score that quantifies the happiness level, is based on various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.\nGDP per Capita:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: A measure of the country’s economic output that accounts for its population.\nFamily:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The degree to which social support is provided in the country, reflecting family ties or community support.\nHealth (Life Expectancy):\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: Average life expectancy in the country, indicating the overall health of the population.\nFreedom:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The level of freedom citizens have to make life choices in the country.\nTrust (Government Corruption):\nData Type: Double (dbl) \nDescription: The level of trust in the country’s government and the perceived amount of corruption.\nGenerosity:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: The average level of generosity of the country’s citizens.\nDystopia Residual:\nData Type: Double (dbl)\nDescription: A hypothetical measure that accounts for the unexplained components of happiness from the six factors evaluated.\n\n\nReason for Choosing this Dataset\nThe World Happiness Report dataset offers a perfect blend of intriguing questions and meaningful insights. By exploring this dataset, we aim to understand the factors that contribute to happiness and well-being across diverse societies. Furthermore, we chose this dataset for the following reasons:\n1. Global Relevance: Happiness is a fundamental aspect of human well-being, and this dataset provides a unique perspective on happiness trends worldwide. Our analysis can offer insights into what makes societies and individuals happy, transcending borders and cultures.\n2. Temporal Insights: The dataset covers a wide range of years, enabling us to track happiness trends and identify potential causative factors over time. This temporal dimension adds depth to our analysis.\n\n\nCleaned Dataset for all Years(2015-2023)\n\n\nRows: 1,368\nColumns: 11\n$ Country                         &lt;chr&gt; \"Switzerland\", \"Iceland\", \"Denmark\", \"…\n$ `Happiness Rank`                &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,…\n$ `Happiness Score`               &lt;dbl&gt; 7.587, 7.561, 7.527, 7.522, 7.427, 7.4…\n$ `GDP per Capita`                &lt;dbl&gt; 1.39651, 1.30232, 1.32548, 1.45900, 1.…\n$ Family                          &lt;dbl&gt; 1.34951, 1.40223, 1.36058, 1.33095, 1.…\n$ `Health (Life Expectancy)`      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.94143, 0.94784, 0.87464, 0.88521, 0.…\n$ Freedom                         &lt;dbl&gt; 0.66557, 0.62877, 0.64938, 0.66973, 0.…\n$ `Trust (Government Corruption)` &lt;dbl&gt; 0.41978, 0.14145, 0.48357, 0.36503, 0.…\n$ Generosity                      &lt;dbl&gt; 0.29678, 0.43630, 0.34139, 0.34699, 0.…\n$ `Dystopia Residual`             &lt;dbl&gt; 2.51738, 2.70201, 2.49204, 2.46531, 2.…\n$ Year                            &lt;dbl&gt; 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 2015, 20…"

We are planning to create a bar chart where the x-axis represents the factors (independent variables), and the y-axis represents their contribution to the overall happiness score. For better visulaization we are planning to choose a Grouped Bar chart, where separate bars represents each factor, and their heights represent their contributions to the overall happiness score. This chart provides a side-by-side comparison of each factor’s contribution. We are planning to expand the analysis by incorporating a stacked bar plot to gain more comprehensive visualization."
