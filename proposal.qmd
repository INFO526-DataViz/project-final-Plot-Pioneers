## Motivation

## Introduction

"Are you happy?" Despite being a straightforward question, philosophers, artists, and scientists have been captivated by it for millennia. We take a wonderful tour through the World Happiness Report dataset in our quest to discover what makes people truly happy around the world. This proposal describes how we want to investigate and examine this interesting dataset, which runs from 2015 to 2023. This project attempts to solve the puzzles of happiness in a playful and interesting way. Happiness is a universal quest.

## Dataset

### Dataset Description

We are excited to embark on a journey to explore the [World Happiness Report dataset](https://worldhappiness.report/data/), encompassing the years 2015 to 2023. This engaging and illuminating dataset offers a unique glimpse into the factors influencing global happiness and well-being. Let's dive into the details of our chosen dataset:

The World Happiness Report dataset is sourced directly from the official [World Happiness Report website](https://worldhappiness.report/). This esteemed report is published annually by the United Nations, offering insights into the state of happiness and well-being across countries. The dataset is meticulously compiled, verified, and updated each year, making it a reliable source for our analysis.

### Dimensions

The dataset consists of a multidimensional treasure trove of information, including but not limited to:

\- Year: A temporal dimension spanning from 2015 to 2023, allowing us to track changes over time.

\- Country: Covering numerous countries around the world, each providing a unique perspective.

\- Happiness Score: A quantitative measure of happiness, serving as the dependent variable.

\- Economic, Social, and Environmental Indicators: Including GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more.

\- Freedom, Corruption, and Generosity Metrics: Providing insights into the cultural and governance aspects influencing happiness.

\- Dystopia Residual: A reference point for low happiness, helping us gauge relative happiness scores.

### Reason for Choosing this Dataset

The World Happiness Report dataset offers a perfect blend of intriguing questions and meaningful insights. By exploring this dataset, we aim to understand the factors that contribute to happiness and well-being across diverse societies. Furthermore, we chose this dataset for the following reasons:

1\. Global Relevance: Happiness is a fundamental aspect of human well-being, and this dataset provides a unique perspective on happiness trends worldwide. Our analysis can offer insights into what makes societies and individuals happy, transcending borders and cultures.

2\. Temporal Insights: The dataset covers a wide range of years, enabling us to track happiness trends and identify potential causative factors over time. This temporal dimension adds depth to our analysis.

## Questions

1.  How do various factors contribute to the overall happiness score across different countries over the years?
2.  Can we identify patterns of change in happiness scores related to global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Analysis plan

-   **Approach for Question 1**

    The different factors involved are as follows : economy ("GDP per capita"), family ("social support"), health("healthy life expectancy at birth"), freedom ("freedom to make life choices"), trust("perceptions of corruption") and genorosity ("genorosity").

    To explore how various factors contribute to the overall happiness score across different countries over the years, we have designed an interactive analysis where users can select a specific year and country from drop-down menus, allowing for a dynamic and personalized exploration of the data. We are planning to create a bar chart where the x-axis represents the factors (independent variables), and the y-axis represents their contribution to the overall happiness score. For better visulaization we are planning to choose a Grouped Bar chart, where separate bars represents each factor, and their heights represent their contributions to the overall happiness score. This chart provides a side-by-side comparison of each factor's contribution. We are planning to expand the analysis by incorporating a stacked bar plot to gain more comprehensive visualization.

-   **Approach for Question 2**

    **Variables Involved:**

    Year (Data Type: Integer): To identify the annual data points and capture trends over time.

    Country (Data Type: Character): For geographical mapping and comparison between nations.

    Happiness Score and related factors (Data Type: Double): To analyze changes and correlations.

    **Variables to be Created:**

    Pandemic Period (Data Type: Character): A derived variable indicating pre-pandemic, during-pandemic, and post-pandemic periods.

    Change in Happiness Score (Data Type: Double): The difference in happiness scores from one year to the next.

    Average Change per Period (Data Type: Double): The average change in happiness scores for each period (pre, during, post-pandemic).

    **Analysis and Visualization:**

    Trend Analysis: Create line graphs to visualize happiness scores over the years, with a clear demarcation of the pandemic period.

    Pandemic Impact: Zoom in on the period of the pandemic to analyze specific shifts or anomalies in happiness trends.

    Correlation and Comparison: Utilize heatmaps to provide a visual correlation matrix between happiness scores and other variables. Conduct statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA) to contrast the differences in happiness levels across different periods.

    Causality and Control: Implement a causal analysis, such as difference-in-differences, to evaluate the pandemic's impact on happiness while controlling for other variables like GDP per capita.

    Visualizations: Develop visualizations that highlight the onset of the pandemic, using markers or shaded areas on the line graphs. Create scatter plots and box plots to compare happiness against other variables across different timeframes.

    Shiny App Features: Intuitive UI guiding through data and findings. Reactive visuals that update with user input. Interactive elements like sliders and drop downs for custom analyses.

    Analysis and Reporting: Note regional happiness shifts and anomalies. Combine statistical results and visual insights. Conclude on the link between pandemic and happiness scores, considering data limits.
